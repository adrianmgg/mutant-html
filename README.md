heads up: the source code here is pretty fucked up. if you need a starting  point:

- /userscript_compile.cjs boils svelte down to a single file
- /docs/ is used as the GH pages site
- /src/ is the svelte source code folder

this uses the <a href="https://mutant.tech">Mutant Standard</a> emoji set.
